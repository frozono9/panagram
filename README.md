## Technical Implementation

The system uses an entropy-based progressive anagram algorithm that:
1. Splits the initial 12 options in half based on the category question
2. Uses letter frequency analysis to find the optimal next question
3. Continues until only one option remains or no more discriminating letters exist

Each category generates 120 images (12 items Ã— 10 variants each) for a realistic Google Images experience.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage Tips for Magicians

1. **Practice the Categories**: Memorize which categories are available and their split questions
2. **Smooth Interaction**: The touch/click detection works best with confident, deliberate movements
3. **Visual Cues**: In magic mode, left column has green hover effect (Yes/Option A), right column has red hover effect (No/Option B)
4. **Backup Plan**: If the system can't narrow down to one answer, it will show the remaining possibilities
5. **Reset**: Click the Google logo to reset and start over+ Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
